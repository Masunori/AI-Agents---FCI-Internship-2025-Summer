        "summary": "Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting\ndeployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower\nnumerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic\nperformance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as\nQuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before\nquantization, using computational invariance: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{Wx} =\n(\\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\\mathbf{Q}$. However, these\nmethods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case\ncoherence $\\mu = 1/\\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight\ndistributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct\noutlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than\none-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces\nHadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by\ncontinuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\\{+1, -1\\}$\nentries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,\nbutterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization\nwhile guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint\nensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \\log\nn)$ computational complexity with only $\\frac{n \\log n}{2}$ learnable\nparameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on\npost-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to\nquantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in\nminutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit\nquantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.",

        "summary": "Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing\nreturns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can\ncomplete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact\nthat marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential\nimprovements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the\nnumber of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --\ncuriously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely\nto make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.\nSelf-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on\nthe ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve\ncomplex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and\nhighlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time\ncompute for long-horizon tasks.",

        "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful\nparadigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by\nlarge-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two\nfundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale\nhuman-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited\ngeneralization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in\nLarge Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can\ndramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural\nquestion: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action\nplanning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL\nframework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce\nVLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment\nrendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,\nSimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\\pi_0$\non RoboTwin 1.0\\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.\nSimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust\ngeneralization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.\nMoreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,\nwherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in\nthe previous training process.

Both signals serve as an exploration bonus\nwithin the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthat the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and\npromotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the\ncritic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.\nEmpirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over\nstandard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks.

This is typically achieved through an \"image-relative\"\napproach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and\nsubgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have\nlimitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and\nembodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an\nembodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we\npresent a new paradigm of learning \"object-relative\" control that exhibits\nseveral desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without\nstrictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction\nproblem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high\ninvariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across\nboth training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric\nmap representation in the form of a \"relative\" 3D scene graph, which is used to\nobtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a\nlocal controller, dubbed \"ObjectReact\", conditioned directly on a high-level\n\"WayObject Costmap\" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB\ninput. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over\nits image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple\nnavigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding\ncapability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction.

Deep\nlearning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases\nsuch as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can\nsuffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related\nto the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related\nto protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against\nunderrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In\nthis work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias\nin DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can\nidentify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or\notherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate\nwhether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model\nperformance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a\nquantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different\nbrain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.\nThrough these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet\nand SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based\nshortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification.

Nonetheless, ECO faces constraints due\nto an imbalance between exploitation and exploration, rendering it susceptible\nto local optima and demonstrating restricted effectiveness in addressing\ncomplex optimization problems. To address these limitations, this study\npresents an enhanced educational competition optimizer (IECO-MCO) utilizing\nmulti-covariance learning operators. In IECO, three distinct covariance\nlearning operators are introduced to improve the performance of ECO. Each\noperator effectively balances exploitation and exploration while preventing\npremature convergence of the population. The effectiveness of IECO is assessed\nthrough benchmark functions derived from the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 test suites,\nand its performance is compared with various basic and improved algorithms\nacross different categories. The results demonstrate that IECO-MCO surpasses\nthe basic ECO and other competing algorithms in convergence speed, stability,\nand the capability to avoid local optima. Furthermore, statistical analyses,\nincluding the Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test,\nare conducted to validate the superiority of IECO-MCO over the compared\nalgorithms. Compared with the basic algorithm (improved algorithm), IECO-MCO\nachieved an average ranking of 2.213 (2.488) on the CE2017 and CEC2022 test\nsuites. Additionally, the practical applicability of the proposed IECO-MCO\nalgorithm is verified by solving constrained optimization problems. The\nexperimental outcomes demonstrate the superior performance of IECO-MCO in\ntackling intricate optimization problems, underscoring its robustness and\npractical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.",

        "summary": "Metaheuristics are widely applied for their ability to provide more efficient\nsolutions. The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based\nmetaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid\nloss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into\nlocal optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address\nthe shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance\nlearning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three\nstrategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning\nstrategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population\ndiversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the\nbootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the\ntendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early\nsearch stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the\nhard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the\nweighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search\nability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is\nproposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the\nstagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus\nenhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed\nMRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test\nset, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the\nFriedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The\nresults show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic\nRIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence\nspeed and stability.",

In this study, we\ninvestigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in\nresume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or\nmisleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines\ndense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to\nimprove both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that\nevaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data\nstratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:\nlow, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables\na fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful\nsubspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG\nintegration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT\nmodels augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR\nregion, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings\nhighlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also\nthe importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model\nbehavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by\nglobal metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human\nResources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and\ncontextual matching are essential.",

This study proposes a\nreduced acquisition scheme for the Connectome 2.0 scanner that preserves model\naccuracy while substantially shortening scan duration. We developed a\ndata-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided\nrecursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset\nfrom a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was\nvalidated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative\nreduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast,\nand test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded\nparameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low\nestimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest\nvariability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the\noptimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in\nwater exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid\noptimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes\nwithout loss of parameter fidelity.
